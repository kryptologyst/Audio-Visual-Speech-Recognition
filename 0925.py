# Project 925. Audio-Visual Speech Recognition

# Audio-visual speech recognition combines both audio and visual cues (like lip movements) to transcribe spoken language. This improves recognition accuracy, especially in noisy environments or for users with speech impairments. In this project, we simulate a basic system using both audio and video frames.

# Here’s a simplified Python implementation using DeepSpeech for audio transcription and OpenCV for lip movement detection:

# 📌 In a real-world scenario, we would need pre-trained models like DeepSpeech for audio recognition and a lip-reading model like LipNet for video input.

import cv2
import numpy as np
import deepspeech
from scipy.io import wavfile
 
# Simulate an audio file path and video file path
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"  # Replace with a real audio file
video_file = "example_video.mp4"  # Replace with a real video file
 
# Step 1: Use DeepSpeech to transcribe the audio part of the speech
model = deepspeech.Model("deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm")  # Pretrained DeepSpeech model
fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
audio_input = np.array(audio, dtype=np.float32)
 
# Perform speech-to-text on the audio
audio_transcription = model.stt(audio_input)
print(f"Audio Transcription: {audio_transcription}")
 
# Step 2: Process video frames for lip reading (simplified)
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_file)
success, frame = cap.read()
 
# Example: Display a frame (simulate lip reading processing)
if success:
    cv2.imshow("Video Frame for Lip Reading", frame)
 
# Wait for a key to close the video window
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
 
# Simulated: Combine audio transcription with video frame analysis
# In a complete system, you would process lip movements in the frame to improve transcription
final_transcription = f"{audio_transcription} with lip movement analysis"
print(f"Final Transcription (Audio + Visual): {final_transcription}")


# What This Does:
# Audio: The DeepSpeech model transcribes speech from the audio file.

# Video: OpenCV is used to capture video frames. In real applications, lip movement detection models (like LipNet) would be used to enhance the transcription accuracy by reading lips.
